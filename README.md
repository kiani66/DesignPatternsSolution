### **🚀 Design Patterns Solution**  

✅ **Implementation of 18 Design Patterns in a Sample System**  

This project demonstrates **18 different design patterns** commonly used in software development. Each pattern is implemented independently in a structured manner, providing a **practical learning resource** for developers looking to understand and apply design patterns effectively.  

---

## **📌 List of Implemented Design Patterns**  

### **1. Behavioral Patterns**  
✅ **Chain of Responsibility** – Manages request flow through a chain of handlers.  
✅ **Command** – Enables execution, undo (reversal), and queuing of commands.  
✅ **Iterator** – Provides a standard way to traverse collections without exposing internal details.  
✅ **Mediator** – Reduces dependencies between classes by introducing a central mediator.  
✅ **Memento** – Captures and restores an object's state without violating encapsulation.  
✅ **Observer** – Implements the publish-subscribe pattern, notifying observers of changes.  
✅ **State** – Allows objects to change behavior based on their internal state.  
✅ **Strategy** – Enables switching between different algorithms at runtime.  
✅ **Template Method** – Defines a skeleton of an algorithm with subclass-specific steps.  
✅ **Visitor** – Adds new operations to existing classes without modifying them.  

### **2. Structural Patterns**  
✅ **Adapter** – Converts an existing interface to another interface required by the client.  
✅ **Bridge** – Decouples abstraction from implementation to enhance flexibility.  
✅ **Composite** – Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly in a tree structure.  
✅ **Decorator** – Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their code.  
✅ **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.  
✅ **Flyweight** – Optimizes memory usage by sharing objects efficiently.  
✅ **Proxy** – Controls access to another object through an intermediary.

## **📌 How to Use**  

🔹 **1. Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiani66/DesignPatternsSolution.git
```  
🔹 **2. Explore each pattern individually.**  
🔹 **3. Run the ConsoleApp project to see the patterns in action.**
