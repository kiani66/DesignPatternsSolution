### **🚀 Design Patterns Solution**  

✅ **Implementation of 18 Design Patterns in a Sample System**  

This project demonstrates **18 different design patterns** commonly used in software development. Each pattern is implemented independently in a structured manner, providing a **practical learning resource** for developers looking to understand and apply design patterns effectively.  

---

## **📌 List of Implemented Design Patterns**  

### **1️⃣ Behavioral Patterns**  
✅ **Chain of Responsibility** – Manages request flow through a chain of handlers.  
✅ **Command** – Enables execution, undo (reversal), and queuing of commands.  
✅ **Iterator** – Provides a standard way to traverse collections without exposing internal details.  
✅ **Mediator** – Reduces dependencies between classes by introducing a central mediator.  
✅ **Observer** – Implements the publish-subscribe pattern, notifying observers of changes.  
✅ **State** – Allows objects to change behavior based on their internal state.  
✅ **Strategy** – Enables switching between different algorithms at runtime.  

### **2️⃣ Structural Patterns**  
✅ **Adapter** – Converts an existing interface to another interface required by the client.  
✅ **Bridge** – Decouples abstraction from implementation to enhance flexibility.  
✅ **Composite** – Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly in a tree structure.  
✅ **Decorator** – Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their code.  
✅ **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.  
✅ **Proxy** – Controls access to another object through an intermediary.  

### **3️⃣ Creational Patterns**  
✅ **Singleton** – Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the application.  
✅ **Factory Method** – Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to specify the actual type.  
✅ **Abstract Factory** – Provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete types.  
✅ **Builder** – Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.  
✅ **Prototype** – Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

## **📌 How to Use**  

🔹 **1. Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiani66/DesignPatternsSolution.git
```  
🔹 **2. Explore each pattern individually.**  
🔹 **3. Run the ConsoleApp project to see the patterns in action.**

## **🎯 Purpose of the Project**  
- Provide a **hands-on learning experience** with **design patterns**.  
- Demonstrate **real-world applications** of each pattern.  
- Improve **code maintainability, flexibility, and scalability**.
