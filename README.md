# Implementation of 18 Design Patterns in a Sample System

This project demonstrates the implementation of 18 different design patterns in a sample system, designed for educational and practical purposes. Each pattern addresses a specific problem and is implemented in various parts of the software. The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding how to use design patterns in real-world projects.

## Key Features

- **18 Design Patterns Implemented**, including:
  - **Chain of Responsibility**: Manage request flow in a chain of handlers.
  - **Command**: Handle commands and provide undo functionality.
  - **Iterator**: Traverse collections easily without exposing internal details.
  - **Mediator**: Centralize interactions between various system components.
  - **Observer**: Notify subscribers when an event occurs.
  - **State**: Manage different states of an object dynamically.
  - **Strategy**: Switch between multiple algorithms or strategies seamlessly.
  - ...and many more.
- Each pattern is implemented in a dedicated and independent section of the project.
- Suitable for students, developers, and anyone looking to practically learn and apply design patterns.
